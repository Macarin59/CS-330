**1. How do I approach designing software?**

This project helped me craft my skills in three dimensional graphics rendering and thinking in three dimensional space in general. 
When designing the program I worked linearly through the course material adding functionality to the project as I learned it. 
A downside of this process is that the older the code was the worse it was unfortunately.
I think the best thing to learn from my design process is that sometimes its worth going back and refactoring old code with a new understanding

**2. How do I approach developing programs?**

When programming I always attempt to aim for modularity, not only is it better for reusability of code and organization, but it is how I think and allows me to more freely code.
Iteration is important in development because nothing is built in a day and each day is not perfect. Going back and adjusting the functionality of code written yesterday is important in the development process for better code overall.
My approach to developing code has evolved throught the milestones by being able to think more critically on what the code I am writing does, how to use it, and where to use it. The more we learned about OpenGL the more options open up.

**3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

Unfortunately this is one of the last classes I have until graduation so I do not think the skills obtained here will have much value in my future educational pathway
but I am taking a game design course next semester and being able to think about computational graphics from the backend has given me a much greater perspective on three dimensional spaces.
As for my future professional pathway I have no idea where my future jobs will take me but computational graphics and visualizations is still useful in case I do ever find myself needing them.
